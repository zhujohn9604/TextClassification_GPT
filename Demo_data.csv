"A facial expression recognition system that uses a face detection apparatus realizing efficient learning and high-speed detection processing based on ensemble learning when detecting an area representing a detection target and that is robust against shifts of face position included in images and capable of highly accurate expression recognition, and a learning method for the system, are provided. When learning data to be used by the face detection apparatus by Adaboost, processing to select high-performance weak hypotheses from all weak hypotheses, then generate new weak hypotheses from these high-performance weak hypotheses on the basis of statistical characteristics, and select one weak hypothesis having the highest discrimination performance from these weak hypotheses, is repeated to sequentially generate a weak hypothesis, and a final hypothesis is thus acquired. In detection, using an abort threshold value that has been learned in advance, whether provided data can be obviously judged as a non-face is determined every time one weak hypothesis outputs the result of discrimination. If it can be judged so, processing is aborted. A predetermined Gabor filter is selected from the detected face image by an Adaboost technique, and a support vector for only a feature quantity extracted by the selected filter is learned, thus performing expression recognition.","Weak hypothesis generation apparatus and method, learning apparatus and method, detection apparatus and method, facial expression learning apparatus and method, facial expression recognition apparatus and method, and robot apparatus",3
"What is disclosed is an automatic method of classification, qualification and relation of information that is based on a network built starting from the semantic, numeric, conceptual, etc. relationships between elements of different sets that are structurally alike. Through the topological properties of the network, we generate a vector of relations for each element that allows us to analyze the similarity among them, improve and facilitate the clustering processes, carry out personalized dynamic ranking, analyze conduct patterns as well as maintain the auto evolving dynamic of the network through the interaction and feedback of its elements, among other characteristics.","Method and system of classifying, ranking and relating information based on weights of network links",5
"A method and system for adapting computer-based personalities, as manifested by textual or audio communications, is disclosed. The communications comprise one or more phrases that may be selected non-deterministically. The frequency distribution of the plurality of potential phrases is updated based on the behaviors of the communications recipients. Thus, the frequency of the selection of phrases included in communications, and hence the 'personality,' of the computer-based system, is influenced by prior usage behaviors. The computer-based personality may also exhibit 'self-awareness' by monitoring changes in phrase frequency distributions over time, as well as being capable of expressing awareness of, and inferences from, changes in the behavior patterns of users over time. ",Adaptive computer-based personalities,5
"Mobile devices, mobile device systems and methods applying to mobile devices are provided that employ intelligent agents in combination with a wide array of remote utilities and information sources to facilitate improving a mobile device user's experience. By collecting contextual information from numerous information sources related to the mobile device user's context, more accurate and optimized determinations and/or inferences are formed relating to which remote utilities to make available to the mobile device user. This facilitates less confusion for the user in selecting desired mobile device content, services, and/or applications. The devices, systems, and methodologies also provide for an improved user experience in an open remote utility provider model.",Intelligent agent for distributed services for mobile devices,5
A computer implemented method and a computer program product provide a provisioning system for automated provisioning of a computing infrastructure by providing relationship factories with resources of the computing infrastructure. The relationship factories include information necessary for establishing relationships within the computing infrastructure. The provisioning system ranks relationship factories according to suitability to provide for appropriate provisioning of new resources added to the computing infrastructure.,Method and computer program product for selecting among multiple provisioning mechanisms in a self-managing computer system,5
"Method, system, and article of manufacture for selecting prospects for a product promotion though data mining. An initial set of prospects in a customer database is identified, by data mining, as initially identified prospects based on predetermined selection criteria. The number of initially identified prospects is compared to a target number of prospects. When the number of initially identified prospects matches the target number of prospects, the initially identified prospects are utilized as the final selection of prospects. When the number of initially identified prospects mismatches the target number of prospects, the final selection of prospects is determined by performing a culling process or an augmenting process to reduce or increase, respectively, the initial set of prospects using a heuristic measure H, until the number of prospects in the initial set of prospects matches the target number of prospects.",Process and heuristic statistic for prospect selection through data mining,5
"An intelligent framework is provided that is disposed between a high-level language environment and a database system environment. According to one embodiment, a software framework infers the need for one or more integrity constraints. The software framework programmatically receives (a) information regarding definitions of a multiple data structures associated with multiple objects participating in a software application, and (b) information regarding relationships among the data structures, where each object represents an instance of a data structure of the multiple data structures. Then, the software framework infers the need for one or more integrity constraints based upon the information regarding definitions of the data structures and the information regarding relationships among the data structures. Finally, the software framework instructs a storage system to apply the one or more integrity constraint.",Software framework that facilitates design and implementation of database applications,5
"The present invention relates to a system for managing a plurality of multi-field classification rules. The system provides a first table that includes a plurality of entries corresponding to a plurality of rules relating to an ingress context and a second table that includes a plurality of entries corresponding to a plurality of rules relating to an egress context. The system also includes a network processor for classifying packets of information, wherein the network processor is programmed to utilize the first table and the second table to identify any rules relating to the ingress context and any one rules relating to the egress context that match a search key.",System for managing multi-field classification rules relating to ingress contexts and egress contexts,99
